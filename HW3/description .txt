Problem 1:
It was honest simple. The only parts I had difficult with were the fact that were 
using binary files. I simply read the first int of each matrix and stored that in n1 and n2
respectively. Then, I read the rest of the ints (n cubed) into my 3D arrays.
Then I did three nested loops and just multiplied each iteration of both 3D arrays
and stored it in the new matrix. Then, i just wrote it to a new file. I was going to 
turn my reading the binary file into a function, and maybe dynamic memory alloction 
but there wasn't really a need to create it into a function, and we didn't learn malloc yet.

Problem 2:

So obviously it was going to be recursive. A lot of this was similar to the PA's in CS280.
I made a function that counted the lines in a file which was almost word for word similar
to some code from one of the PA's. Then, the traverse directory function which required me
to have to look up some stuff. Mostly because I don't use them a lot and couldn't rememeber 
the names. I think we learned structs in class so I used two here. But both of them are
predefined and help with dealing with directories and files. I defined a MAX_LENGTH for the
path. If the path was too long I didn't know if we should continue (aka skip) or exit the 
program? In the end, if file was .txt, append total lines with the function total lines.
In main I just ask for file name and I wrote 2 lines to ignore a ./ if the user puts that in.
I hope it doesn't mess anything up but I also don't know if its needed.
