Problem 1:
First implement the swap function which swaps the tiles. Then, the update_fgh, which computes f,g,h values
for nodes. H's manhattan distance is the hueristic value. Expand function fills succ_nodes with valid moves
of the blank tile which is up down left right. Then, for the A* logic, we need to expand the node with the smallest
f value. Terminate when the goal state matches the current node and print the solution. For merge to open i made sure 
to insert value succesors into the list, then continously keep the list sorted by the f value of the nodes. This is critical,
as it basically allows the A* algo to know where to go next. For the results, my path length is always one more than what is 
expected. That is because the skeleton code increments pathlen on line 277 when it shouldn't be inside the 'do'.
Other than that, everything else went rather smoothly. I didn't come across many issues since I remember A* so well from 288 
with Itani. I studied it like crazy cuz I wanted to pass the class.
