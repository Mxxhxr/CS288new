Problem 1:
So first I basically wrote the code without the use of MPI. This code isn't anything 
complicated or new. The count sort is simple and I used gendatai and checkdatai and 
confirmed that everything is working as it should be. This saves me from the hassle
of trying to implmenet MPI and the problem at hand at the same time. It wasn't that bad of an approach.
The begenning and ending were easy. Where all I had to do was initialize and finalize mpi. But having to
broadcast an scatter as well as 2 buffers complicated things more than I wanted it to. I put a lot of checks
just incase anything were to go wrong I could weed out the "easier" errors like opening a file error etc.
I was getting errors because it coulnd't distribute evenly and the fix for that took me quite some time.
And as per the HW, im assuming for grading this assignment that the number of ints and the number of processes
will be divisible. I also commendted our the include mpi because my machine was being wierd but i put it back 
before submitting.

Problem 2:
Threads to me is a lot more intuitive and makes more sense than using MPI. Essentially
I made a struct then I just created a function for cacluating pi with the use of threads.
Then, in main, i just created the threads and used the calculatePi function. Then at the end,
I joined the threads using the join function and then i did the final calculation of pi and thats it.
